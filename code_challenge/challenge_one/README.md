## Approach & Efficiency :
- I used the following approach:
- first I created the original array
- Then I created the function for the reveres purpose.
- inside this function created new list with the same length of the original arr.
- Inside this function I added while loop.
- Inside each iteration I assigned the index for the original array as decrementing and for the new array as incrementing.
- Ii will return the new list and assign the value of the function to the original list.
