#  Binary Search of Sorted Array
- a function which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available ,it will return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array..

## Approach & Efficiency :
- create the function for
 the binary search purpose.
-create a variable to hold the default value in case no match which will be -1
-Inside this function add for loop that will iterate from the 0 index to the last index of the list
-inside it put if statement to check if the value entered equal any values inside the list.
- When match occur and the condition is true then assign the iteration number to the variable and return the variable
