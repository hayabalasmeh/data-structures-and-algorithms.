# Insert to Middle of an Array
- -Writing a function called insert_shift_list which takes in an list and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available, it will return an array with the new value added at the middle index

## Approach & Efficiency :
- I used the following approach:
- first I created the original array
- Then I created the function for the reveres purpose.
- Inside this function I created new list with the same elements of the original list in addition to 0 default element and assign the middle index to variable.
-Inside this function I add for loop that will iterate from the last index of the new list to the middle index
-inside each iteration which start from the last index so will assign the value of the previous index to the last index until I reach the middle index by that I will assign the value entered to the middle index for the new array
- It will return the new list and assign the value of the function to the original list.
