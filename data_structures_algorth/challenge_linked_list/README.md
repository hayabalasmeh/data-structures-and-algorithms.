# Singly Linked List
#### Creation of linked list class and a node class with methods enable to add multiple values to the linked list and checking if value does exist and return representation of the collection of values that it has.

## Challenge
#### Creation of linked list class and a node class with methods enable to add multiple values to the linked list and checking if value does exist and return representation of the collection of values that it has.

## Approach & Efficiency
#### I have used classes approach for this challenge, O(1) Time performance.

## API
1-Insert: Adds a new node with that value (as argument) to the head of the list.

2- Includes: Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist and Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists

3- to string: Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
