    - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- insert before method which take as arguments: value, new value:
    - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- insert after method which take as arguments: value, new value
    - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified.
