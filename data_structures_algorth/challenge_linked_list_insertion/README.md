# Challenge Summary
## creation and testing alinked list that has methods to append and insert before and after a value.

## Whiteboard Process
- As I can remember we have been told at the last week that the code is enough for submission

## Approach & Efficiency
- Big O notation :
- O(n)

## Solution
- I have build a linked list that has the following functionality :

- append method which take as arguments: new value.
    - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- insert before method which take as arguments: value, new value:
    - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- insert after method which take as arguments: value, new value
    - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified.
