- Creating a Binary Tree class and Binary Search Tree class

## Challenge
- Creating a Binary Tree class and Binary Search Tree class

## Approach & Efficiency

- Big O(n)

## API
- Binary tree:

- Created a Binary Tree class that contain:

- a method for each of the depth first traversals:
    - pre order
    - in order
    - post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

- Binary Search Tree

- Created a Binary Search Tree class that contain:
      
    - Add: Arguments: value , Return: nothing
        - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    - Contains:Argument: value
        - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once
