# Graphs

- New implementation 

## Challenge

- Implementing graph data structure using an adjacency list

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API

-The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

- add node
- Arguments: value
- Returns: The added node
- Add a node to the graph
- add edge
- Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
- Returns: nothing
- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
- get nodes
- Arguments: none
- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
get neighbors
- Arguments: node
- Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
size
- Arguments: none
- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
